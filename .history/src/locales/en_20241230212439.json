                "content": "Before I joined a company, I gained a lot of experience and challenges during my internship at NC SOFT. Watching professionals work was truly inspiring and made me think, 'Someday, I must be like them.' Through challenges and experiences, I met many people, exchanged ideas, and built relationships during the training period, which I believe is invaluable later in life. I think successful achievements are not based solely on the talent of one person but are realized through the opinions, experiences, and wisdom of many. Although I majored in planning, I take pride in my programming knowledge and my ability to communicate effectively with planners, which I consider a significant strength."

                "content": "Although I did not major in programming, I am well aware of my own shortcomings. With persistent effort, I have developed a variety of VR games and content. Over my eight years as a developer, I worked my way up to becoming a programming team lead. However, I constantly reflect on my inadequacies and maintain a mindset of continuous learning. I have extensive experience working with tools like Unity and Unreal Engine, as well as various VR devices and simulators. My projects include data-driven work using Raspberry Pi and web metaverse projects utilizing PlayCanvas. Recognizing my weaknesses, I studied Vue.js, creating a web portfolio and even developing a game currency calculator.With the language skills I gained through studying abroad and teaching myself Japanese, I have traveled to the United States and Japan for business trips, where I collaborated with local teams and served as an interpreter. I also translated and explained pamphlets to foreigners during exhibitions at COEX and KINTEX. As a result, I have worked not only with programming languages but also with spoken languages. To date, I have worked on over 30 projects, both large and small, and have even managed a VR arcade."

            "content": "The personality trait I am most proud of is my fearless approach to challenges. From studying abroad to creating games with diverse teams for the first time, I have never hesitated to step into the unknown. Additionally, I always take pride in wherever I belong and strive to make that place the best it can be, continuously improving myself in the process. One aspect I would like to change about myself is that I tend to focus on a single task with great intensity. While I excel at mastering one task, I sometimes neglect others when I have multiple responsibilities. A good example of my personality is when I participated in a game jam at my school, where we created a simple game in 48 hours. I was so motivated that I worked for over 30 hours, and my classmates praised my dedication. Inspired by this feedback, I tackled the next project, IronShadow, a 2D game that was my first attempt at programming as a developer. Despite numerous challenges, I found joy in overcoming obstacles and completing the project. For my final project, Shroud, I delved into 3D AI programming for the first time. The project was highly successful, and while many people said it would be impossible, it was a deeply meaningful challenge for me."
